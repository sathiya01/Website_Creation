                            <h1>Meditation Basics</h1>
        <div>
        <p>Most meditations begin by sitting in a quiet place, closing the eyes, calming the mind, and focusing on the breath. 
            But there is more to meditating than sitting quietly and breathing. When we meditate, we are essentially cultivating awareness and compassion; 
            we are training the mind to stop being easily distracted and instead be more focused in the present moment. 
            Using the breath as our anchor in the moment, we simply sit and gradually learn to let thoughts and feelings come and go.</p>
        <p>Of course, it is completely normal when we start to meditate for the mind to jump all over the place. The nature of mind is to think, 
           so it is going to think  meditation is not about stopping thoughts. We sit and practice to observe our thinking without getting 
           caught up in our thoughts and emotions.We learn to tame this restlessness by developing an awareness for those moments when our
           attention has wandered off. Each time we notice we are distracted, we build our awareness, and we bring our attention back to the
           breath.Through the process of meditation, the mind becomes more comfortable with this idea of sitting still, and
           we can begin to learn how to integrate the qualities experienced during meditation practice calmness, focus, compassion, 
           mindfulness into the rest of our day.</p>
